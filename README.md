## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

For this challenge I got my first attempt using Grid.

Frontend Mentor always has good challenge designs to build, this was also another good design challenge for me. Key takeaways for this challenge:
- HTML Markup structure **critical**
- Switching between Flexbox and Grid on uses cases I encountered
- As a Frontend developer one needs to be able to pay close attention to the details of the design spec provided and do absolute best to re-produce the same design.


**My approach**
- Build the mock-up with the mobile-design approach.
- Markout sections on the design that will be broken down into my HTML Markup
- Setup basic styles to be used for my typography.

**My challenges**
- Creating a responsive page across different devices. 

**Final takeaway**
- Definitely more practice in doing the challenges to get a good hang of building the designs.
- This challenge showed me how reponsive design becomes very easy once your HTML mark-up has been created correctly.
- I'm happy on the outcome - there is always room for improvement and I undertake to check other peoples solutions and see how they approached doing this challenge.
